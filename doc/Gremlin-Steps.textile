[[https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/raw/master/doc/images/gremlin-pipe.png|float|align=left]] Gremlin comes with a collection of predefined steps. Gremlin steps map to a particular @Pipe@ in "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com. A @Pipe<S,E>@ extends @Iterator<E>@ and @Iterable<E>@. It takes an object of type @S@ and emits and object of type @E@. Chaining pipes together creates a @Pipeline@. In essence, Gremlin is a "DSL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language for constructing @Pipeline@ objects. Finally, be sure to look at [[User Defined Steps]] to learn how to define your own custom steps.

h1. Step Library

Even link in a pipeline is called a step. Steps can be categorized as either being transform-, filter-, sideEffect-, or branch- based.

* @step@: a generic, general-purpose computational step.
** @transform@: take an object and emit a transformation of it.
** @filter@: decide whether to allow an object to pass or not.
** @sideEffect@: pass the object, but yield some side effect.
** @branch@: decide which step to take.

h3. Notes

  * If a pipe's argument is postfixed with a @?@, then the argument is optional. When no argument is provided, a reasonable default argument is created.
  * If you come up a with a generally useful step/pipe and would like to include it into the main Gremlin distribution, please make an "issue":https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/issues or provide the appropriate pull request.
